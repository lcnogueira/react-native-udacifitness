# Udacifitness

This project is the exercise of the third module of the [Udacity's Redux course](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). **I did not create this project from scratch. The instructor did it.**

## How to start the app

After cloning this project, you have to install and run the app:
```
cd react-native-udacifitness
yarn add
yarn start
```

You have to install a simulator too. I suggest using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/). After installing it, you can follow the guide [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/genymotion.html), so that `exp` can communicate with Genymotion.

Once everything is installed and Genymotion is running, hit the "_a_" button to open Android emulator, or "_i_" to open iOS emulator.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
